No pelvic sidewall invasion, pelvic organ(s) (rectum, bladder \n\nor other______) invasion.\n\n\n\nRegional nodal metastasis:\n\nThere is regional nodal metastasis at obturator (bilateral), external iliac (\n\nbilateral) areas.\n\n\n\nDistant metastasis (In this study):\n\nThere is equivocal distant metastasis at non-regional lymph nodes including \n\ninguinal area. D.D.: reactive lymph nodes or lymph node metastasis. \n\nNo metastasis at bone (or others) shown in this imaging study.\n\n\n\nOther findings:\n\nLarge liver cyst in S4 of liver. \n\nA nodular lesion at S8/S4 of liver, 2.4 cm, suggest sonography correlation.\n\n\n\nIMP:\n\nProstate cancer, MRI staging: T3bN1.\n\n\n\n＜摘要＞\n\n  報告共同醫師：王劭中(0540)須進行其他檢查再評估，請立即回診追蹤。(BI-RADS:0)"
